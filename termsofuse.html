                this reference but such additional terms and conditions shall control solely for the applicable
                Service.</p>We may modify this Agreement from time to time and such modification shall be effective upon
            posting on the Services. You will be deemed to have agreed to any such modifications by your further use of
            the Services after any such modification is posted. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement

                posting personally identifiable information from other users.</p>
            <p>Any conduct by you in violation of the foregoing prohibitions may result in the suspension or termination
                of your access to the Services.</p>
            <h2>CONTENT</h2>

                check the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating for the film from which the video content
                is taken in order to ensure that you are comfortable viewing such material. We do not warrant the

                party licensors, and/or our advertising partners. You may view the Proprietary Materials for your

                publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, create derivative works from, or in any other
                way exploit any Proprietary Materials.</p>
            <h2>LINKS/EXTERNAL SITES</h2>
            <p>The Services may contain links or embed access to websites operated by third parties, including those
                through which you may make purchases. We do not monitor or control the external sites and make no
                representations regarding, and are not liable or responsible for the accuracy, completeness, timeliness,
                reliability or availability of, any of the content uploaded, displayed, or distributed, or products, or
                services available at these sites. If you choose to access any third party site, you do so at your own
                risk. The presence of a link to a third party site does not constitute or imply our endorsement,
                sponsorship, or recommendation of the third party or of the content, products, or services contained on,
                or available through, the third party site and we will not be a party to or in any way be responsible
                for monitoring any transaction between you and third-party providers of such products, services, or
                information, or for ensuring the confidentiality of your credit card information. Any disputes you may
                encounter with a third party service provider shall be settled solely between you and the service
                provider.</p>
            <h2>DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
            <p>YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. ALL CONTENT APPEARING ON THE WEBSITE
                IS PROVIDED "AS IS, AS AVAILABLE" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO ITS CORRECTNESS,
                ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR OTHERWISE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT OPERATION OF THE WEBSITE WILL BE
                UNINTERRUPTED OR FREE FROM ERRORS, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED OR THAT THE WEBSITE WILL BE FREE OF
                VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>
            <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE, OUR PARTNERS OR LICENSORS, OR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING OR MAINTAINING
                THE WEBSITE OR ANY OF ITS CONTENT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR
                PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION ARISING OUT
                OF YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR ANY BREACH OF
                THESE TERMS SHALL BE TO CEASE USING THE SERVICES.</p>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of certain warranties or conditions, so some
                of the above exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
            <h2>LEGALITY</h2>
            <p>You are subject to all laws of the state(s) and countries in which you reside and from which you access
                the Services and are solely responsible for obeying those laws. You agree we cannot be held liable if
                laws applicable to you restrict or prohibit your participation. We make no representations or
                warranties, implicit or explicit, as to your legal right to participate in any Services nor shall any
                person affiliated, or claiming affiliation with the Services have authority to make any such
                representations or warranties.</p>
            <h2>APPLICABLE LAW / BINDING ARBITRATION</h2>
            <p>The Services are created and controlled by us in the State of California. As such, the laws of the State
                of California will govern these Terms of Use, without giving effect to any provisions of California law
                that direct the choice of another stateâ€™s laws.</p>
            <p>Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related agreement, their
                enforcement or interpretation, or because of an alleged breach, default or misrepresentation in
                connection with any of their provisions, shall be determined by binding arbitration. The arbitration
                proceedings shall be held and conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Comprehensive
                Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (the &ldquo;JAMS Rules&rdquo;), as modified by this Agreement.
                Such arbitration shall occur in Los Angeles, California, and be initiated by any party in accordance
                with the JAMS Rules. The demand for arbitration shall be made by any party hereto within a reasonable
                time after the claim, dispute or other matter in question has arisen, and in any event shall not be made
                after the date when institution of legal proceeding, based on such claim, dispute or other matter in
                question, would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Discovery issues shall be decided by
                the arbitrator. Post-hearing briefs shall be permitted. The arbitrator shall render a decision within
                twenty (20) days after the conclusion of the hearing(s). In reaching a decision, the arbitrator shall
                have no authority to change, extend, modify or suspend any of the terms of this Agreement, or to grant
                an award or remedy any greater than that which would be available from a court under the statutory or
                common law theory asserted. The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion that includes the factual and
                legal basis for any decision and award. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of
                remedies, if applicable) of California or federal law, or any of them, as applicable to the claim(s)
                asserted. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties may
                seek, from a court of competent jurisdiction, provisional remedies or injunctive relief in support of
                their respective rights and remedies hereunder without waiving any right to arbitration. However, the
                merits of any action that involves such provisional remedies or injunctive relief, including, without
                limitation, the terms of any permanent injunction, shall be determined by arbitration under this
                paragraph. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
                jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator shall allocate all costs and expenses of the arbitration (including
                legal and accounting fees and expenses of the respective parties) to the parties in the proportions that
                reflect their relative success on the merits (including the successful assertion of any defenses).</p>
            <h2>INDEMNITY</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Odin Domains, LLC, our subsidiaries, partners and affiliates, and our
                respective officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or
                demand, including reasonable attorneys&apos; fees, due to or arising out of (i) your use of the Services
                in violation of this Agreement, (ii) a breach of this Agreement including your representations and
                warranties set forth above and/or (iii) if your acts or omissions causes us to be liable to another.</p>
            <h2>AGE OF USERS</h2>
            <p>We do not intend the Services to be used by minors under the age of 13. Furthermore, we do not market the
                Services for use by minors under the age of 13. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you must
                obtain your parent or legal guardianâ€™s permission before making use of the Services.</p>
            <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
            <p>The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be severable. If for any reason any provision of this
                Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision
                shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
                without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the
                remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or
                provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles
                in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
            <h2>MODIFICATION</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to make changes to the Services, posted policies and these Terms of Use at any time
                without notice other than the reposting of the modified Terms of Use so check back frequently.</p>

                questions regarding this Agreement, including if you have any questions about material changes that may
                have been made to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
