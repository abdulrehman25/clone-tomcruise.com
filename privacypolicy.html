                <li><strong>&ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;</strong> is the type of information that specifically
                    identifies you personally and/or can be used alone to contact you online or offline, such as your

                    information, credit card information and, in some cases, user names; and

                <li><strong>&ldquo;Non-personal Information&rdquo;</strong> is anonymous information about your computer
                    and mobile device, such as your unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other
                    persistent identifiers, and their hardware/software/firmware, as well as data regarding your use of

                </li>

            <h3>Personal Information, Non-personal Information and Other Information That We Collect and How We Collect
                It</h3>
            <p>In general, we do not require nor request any Personal Information from you when you use our Website.
                From time to time, we may offer certain services, such as a newsletter, that will require you to provide
                us with Personal Information should you choose to take part. In addition, if you reach out to us in any
                way, or in any other way take steps that require the submission of Personal Information, we would
                collect whatever Personal Information or any other information you choose to submit and use it for the
                purposes for which you submitted it.</p>
            <p>As noted, we will only collect Personal Information if you choose to submit it to us. However, we, or
                third party analytics services on our behalf, may collect aggregated, anonymous Usage Data when you use
                our Website.</p>
            <p>A special note about cookies and other identifiers: In connection with the foregoing collection of Usage
                Data, we may also use cookies or similar technologies (tiny files that are stored on your computer&apos;s
                hard drive or mobile device when you visit certain web pages that identify your computer and may store
                Usage Data about you). Should you choose to submit Personal Information to us, we may link cookie
                information to such Personal Information. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when
                cookies are being sent. However, some aspects of our Website will not function properly if you do so and
                you may lose access to the services you wish to use.</p>
            <h3>Use of the Personal Information That We Collect</h3>
            <p>In the event we collect Personal Information from you, we will only use it to the limited extent required
                to provide you with the services or functionality you have requested (e.g., to send you a newsletter or
                e-mail updates) or to respond to your inquiries.</p>
            <h3>Use of the Non-personal Information That We Collect</h3>
            <p>Usage Data in aggregated, anonymous form may be used by us for administrative, analytical, research,
                optimization, and security purposes.</p>
            <h3>Disclosure of the Personal Information and Non-personal Information That We Collect</h3>
            <p>In the event we offer features that require us to contact you (e.g., newsletter), we may use the services
                of third party service providers to assist us with executing such features and may be required to share
                your Personal Information with such service providers for that purpose. In no event will we ever sell,
                rent or transfer your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes or for any
                other reasons other than those described above. Usage Data in aggregated, anonymous form may be shared
                with third parties who assist us with our internal operations such as administration, analytics,
                research, and optimization. If we share your Personal Information or Usage Data with third parties as
                described above, they will be authorized to use such information only for the purposes for which they
                were engaged.</p>
            <p>Our Website may offer social sharing features such as &ldquo;Share&rdquo; or &ldquo;Like&rdquo; on
                Facebook or other third party social networking sites. If you decide to use such features, it may allow
                the sharing and collection of Personal Information and Usage Data both to and from such third-party
                social networks. In addition, should you choose to submit any Personal Information to or through such
                social networks, the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information will be governed by the
                privacy policies of those social networks, not by this policy. Therefore, you should visit the policies
                of such third parties for more information about their information collection practices.</p>
            <p>Finally, we may share your Personal Information: (i) In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other
                legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as
                otherwise required by law - in such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or
                right available to us; (ii) When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action
                regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety
                of our company, our users, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements; or
                (iii) In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset
                sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>
            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <p>You represent and warrant that all Personal Information you choose to provide us, if any, is true and
                correct and relates to you and not to any other person.</p>
            <p>If you wish to opt out of further communications from us, or if you wish to review, delete and/or revise
                the Personal Information we have stored about you, please contact us with your specific request at <a

                anonymous version of such information.</p>

                features will function properly as a result.</p>

            <h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
            <p>Under certain circumstances, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 requires that, upon receipt of a
                request by a customer residing in California, a business is required to provide a list of all third
                parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year for direct marketing
                purposes, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. However, the
                foregoing does not apply to businesses like ours that do not disclose Personal Information to third
                parties for direct marketing purposes without prior approval or that give customers a free mechanism to
                opt out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing
                purposes. Users residing in California may request further information about our approach to this law by
                writing to us at <a class="highlighted"

                line &ldquo;CA Request for Information,&rdquo; and requesting further information.</p>
            <p>Do Not Track Disclosures in California: due to technological limitations, we cannot guarantee that our
                Website will be able to abide by any &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; technology that you may choose to
                utilize.</p>
            <h3>Changes</h3>
