        <div class="bl-body"><p>TOM CRUISE is a global cultural icon who has made an immeasurable impact on cinema by
            creating some of the most memorable characters of all time. Having achieved extraordinary success as an
            actor, producer and philanthropist in a career spanning over three decades, Cruise is a three-time Oscar®
            nominee and three-time Golden Globe Award® winner whose films have earned over $10 billion in worldwide box
            office—an incomparable accomplishment. Eighteen of Cruise’s films have grossed over $100 million
            domestically, and a record 23 have made more than $200 million globally. His latest film, Mission:
            Impossible – Fallout has made over $775 million worldwide becoming Cruise’s most successful film to
            date.</p>
            <p>Cruise has starred in numerous legendary films such as Top Gun, Jerry Maguire, Risky Business, Minority
                Report, Interview with the Vampire, A Few Good Men, The Firm, Rain Man, Collateral, The Last Samurai,
                Edge of Tomorrow, The Color of Money and the Mission: Impossible series, among many others. Combined,
                the Mission: Impossible franchise has brought in over $3.5 billion since Cruise conceived the idea for a
                film adaptation of the classic television series and produced the first in 1996. He is currently in
                production on the long-awaited sequel to Top Gun.</p>
            <p>A consummate filmmaker involved in all aspects of production, Cruise has proven his versatility with the
                films and roles he chooses. He has made 43 films, contributing in a producing role on many of them, and
                collaborated with a remarkable list of celebrated film directors including Francis Ford Coppola, Ridley
                Scott, Tony Scott, Martin Scorsese, Barry Levinson, Oliver Stone, Ron Howard, Rob Reiner, Sydney
                Pollack, Neil Jordan, Brian De Palma, Cameron Crowe, Stanley Kubrick, Paul Thomas Anderson, Ed Zwick,
                Steven Spielberg, Michael Mann, J.J. Abrams, Robert Redford, Brad Bird, Doug Liman and Christopher
                McQuarrie.</p>
            <p>Cruise received Academy Award® nominations for Best Actor for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry
                Maguire. He was a Best Supporting Actor nominee for Magnolia and won Golden Globes (Best Actor) for Born
                on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire, in addition to a Best Supporting Actor prize for Magnolia. He
                also received Golden Globe nominations for his roles in Risky Business, A Few Good Men and The Last
                Samurai. Cruise has earned acting nominations and awards from BAFTA, the Screen Actors Guild, the
                Chicago Film Critics Association and the National Board of Review.</p>
            <p>Cruise’s previous few films include the critically acclaimed American Made, The Mummy, Mission:
                Impossible – Rogue Nation, Oblivion and the suspense thriller Jack Reacher, which earned $218 million
                worldwide. Prior to that, he made a memorable appearance in Ben Stiller’s comedy smash Tropic Thunder,
                as the foul-mouthed Hollywood movie mogul Les Grossman. This performance, based on a character Cruise
                created, earned him praise from critics and audiences as well as his seventh Golden Globe
                nomination.</p>
            <p>Cruise has been honored with tributes ranging from Harvard’s Hasty Pudding Man of the Year Award to the
                John Huston Award from the Artists Rights Foundation and the American Cinematheque Award for
                Distinguished Achievement in Film. In addition to his artistic contributions, Cruise has used his
                professional success as a vehicle for positive change, becoming an international advocate, activist and
                philanthropist in the fields of health, education and human rights. He has been honored by the Mentor LA
                organization for his work on behalf of the children of Los Angeles and around the world. In 2011 Cruise
                received the Simon Wiesenthal Humanitarian Award and the following year he received the Entertainment
                Icon Award from the Friars Club for his outstanding accomplishments in the entertainment industry and in
                the humanities. He is the fourth person to receive this honor after Douglas Fairbanks, Cary Grant and
                Frank Sinatra. Empire magazine awarded Cruise its Legend of Our Lifetime Award in 2014. Most recently,
                Cruise was the first actor to receive The Will Rogers Motion Picture Pioneers Foundation’s Pioneer of
                the Year Award in 2018.</p></div>
